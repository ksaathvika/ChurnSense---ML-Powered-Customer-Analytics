# ChurnSense-ML Powered Customer Analytics
Overview:
Built a comprehensive machine learning system to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using a dataset of 7,043 customers with 38 behavioral and demographic features.
Key Technical Components:

Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed telecom customer data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
Feature Engineering: Applied normalization, outlier detection, and PCA dimensionality reduction techniques
Model Development: Implemented and compared 6 ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes)
Optimization: Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance

Results:

Best Model: Logistic Regression achieved 92.24% accuracy with 0.93 ROC-AUC score
Business Impact: Identified key churn drivers including contract type, tenure, and monthly charges
Performance: Delivered 86% precision and 86% recall for churn prediction

Technologies Used:
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
This project demonstrates your ability to handle end-to-end machine learning workflows, from data preprocessing through model optimization and business impact analysis.
